Write a program using OnlineGDB that will:

1.	Given an angle "theta" (less than 90 deg) and hypotenuse length from the user,
calculate the lengths of the opposite and adjacent lengths of a right triangle.
2.	calculate the area of the triangle and output all results to the screen.

Requirements: The units of measure (cm, meters, inches, feet) should be determined by the user input and included in the output.  The precision of the output should be 4 significant digits

You must include your Algorithm steps
